 <h3>Hello class!!!</h3>
   <P>First I am going to introduce myself, i am from ghana,<br> in the state of accra. Something that I really like is everything related to technology, in my country I studied a bit  computer engineering major,<br> and i am currently  taking courses in byui  related to cybersecurity. 
    Learning new things, no matter what they are, as long as they are intriguing, is something I enjoy. <br> I also enjoy sports and play soccer.
    i am taking this course to help me gain a basic understanding of html and vs code <br>everything im going to learning is new to me and as such i am pumped 
    to be taking this class. <br>i hope that by the end of this course , i would have gained a basic understanding of how to work with vs code at least in the general sense.</p>
