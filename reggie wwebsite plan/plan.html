            <h2 class="home-headline-1">OUR VISION</h2>
            <p class="home-paragraph-1">  The objective is to help small and medium-scale farmers in West Africa sub-region mainly producing high demand to produce areas of Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Côte d’Ivoire, Benin, and Togo to increase sustainably their income and food supply by connecting them to suppliers, Agro-food processing plants, truck Drivers, Market women supermarkets, and exporters for the international market
Our mission is to improve the livelihoods and incomes of cocoa farmers through gender equity and sustainable cocoa production. We achieved this by offering practical, scientific knowledge on cocoa farming and good agricultural practices; certification to ensure sustainable cocoa production; Tailor made input packages such as fertilizers and crop protection products on credit; good governance and structure that promotes affirmative action; state of the art warehousing solutions and access to a Cocoa Abrabopa Pension Scheme.</p></div>

            <h2 class="home-headline-2">Background History</h2>
            <p class="home-paragraph-2">Agriculture is African's most important economic sector, employing more than half the population on a formal and informal basis and accounting for almost half of GDP and export earnings. The country produces a variety of crops in various climatic zones which range from dry savanna to wet forest and which run in eastwest bands across the country. Agricultural crops, including yams, grains, cocoa, oil palms, kola nuts, and timber, form the base of Ghana's economy. The people of the north attempted to reduce its role in marketing and assistance to farmers in several ways. In particular, the Cocoa Marketing Board steadily relinquished its powers over pricing and marketing. The government, furthermore, established a new farmers' organization, the Ghana National Association of Farmers and Fishermen, in early 1991 to replace the Ghana Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives.
The new organization was to be funded by the farmers themselves to operate as a cooperative venture at the district, regional, and national levels. Although the government argued that it did not want to be accused of manipulating farmers, the lack of government financial support again put subsistence producers at a disadvantage.  </p></div>
