        Agriculture is African's most important economic sector, employing more than half the population on a formal and informal basis and accounting for almost half of GDP and export earnings. The country produces a variety of crops in various climatic zones which range from dry savanna to wet forest and which run in eastwest bands across the country. Agricultural crops, including yams, grains, cocoa, oil palms, kola nuts, and timber, form the base of Ghana's economy.

      <h3>History about agriculture in  Africa </h3>
      <p>
        Agriculture is African's most important economic sector, employing more than half the population on a formal and informal basis and accounting for almost half of GDP and export earnings. The country produces a variety of crops in various climatic zones which range from dry savanna to wet forest and which run in eastwest bands across the country. <br>
        Agricultural crops, including yams, grains, cocoa, oil palms, kola nuts, and timber, form the base of Ghana's economy.<br>
        The people of the north attempted to reduce its role in marketing and assistance to farmers in several ways.<br>
        In particular, the Cocoa Marketing Board steadily relinquished its powers over pricing and marketing. <br>
        The government, furthermore, established a new farmers' organization, the Ghana National Association of Farmers and Fishermen, in early 1991 to replace the Ghana Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives. The new organization was to be funded by the farmers themselves to operate as a cooperative venture at the district, regional, and national levels. Although the government argued that it did not want to be accused of manipulating farmers, the lack of government financial support again put subsistence producers at a disadvantage.

      <h3>Produce</h3>
      <p>
    For over 81 years Agriculture in Ghana has been regulated by one of its highest yielding exports-Cocoa.Cocoa is Ghana's principal agricultural export.<br>
        Cocoa production occurs in the forested areas of Ghana: Ashanti Region, Brong-Ahafo Region, Central Region, Eastern Region, Western Region, and Volta Region.<br>
        The crop year begins in October while the smaller mid-crop cycle starts in July. All cocoa, except that which is smuggled out of the country, is sold at fixed prices. Although most cocoa production is carried out by peasant farmers, <br>
        small number of farmers appear to dominate the trade.The government controls the industry through the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod). As of 2010, Ghana's cocoa bean exports were valued at $2,219.5 million (US)

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:
  
        At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.
        Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.
        Next we have some text and an image
        ...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.
        Then one more section of text with no image.
        Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3 social media icons.</p>
